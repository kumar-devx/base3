What I need
I'm training Rocket League AI bots using reinforcement learning. Right now I'm using RocketSim (https://github.com/ZealanL/RocketSim) which simulates the game physics, but it runs on CPU and that's my bottleneck. I've got dual RTX 5090s sitting there not doing much during simulation.
I want someone to port RocketSim to CUDA so I can run thousands of game simulations in parallel on GPU instead.
What RocketSim does

Ball physics (bouncing, spin, gravity)
Car physics (driving, jumping, flipping, boosting, flying)
Collisions between cars, ball, and the arena walls/floor/ceiling
Boost pads, goals, demos, all that stuff

It's all open source C++ so you can dig through it.
What I'm hoping for

CUDA version that can step a ton of environments at once
Returns states as batched tensors I can feed into my neural network
Accuracy close enough to the original that my bots still play properly
Ideally 1M+ steps per second on one GPU

I'm flexible on how we do this
Happy to start with a proof of concept—like just get the ball physics working on GPU first, make sure the approach is solid, then expand from there. Milestone payments are fine.
Before you reach out
Take a look at the RocketSim code and let me know:

Have you done anything like this before?
How would you approach it?
Rough idea on time and cost?

Cheers!

Hi, I’ve reviewed RocketSim and I’ve worked on GPU-accelerated physics and RL simulation before.
I’d approach this by redesigning RocketSim into a data-oriented CUDA pipeline (SoA), stepping thousands of environments in parallel and returning batched tensors for training.
I suggest starting with a GPU proof-of-concept (ball physics + arena collisions) to validate accuracy and performance, then expanding to full car physics and collisions in milestones.
Rough timeline: 1–2 weeks for PoC, 6–10 weeks for a full playable GPU simulator.

Happy to discuss scope, milestones, and budget.
Let me know if you’d like to proceed.

Sounds good, your approach makes sense. Before we nail down scope, here's the training framework I'm using that calls RocketSim: https://github.com/ZealanL/GigaLearnCPP-Leak
Worth taking a look so the CUDA version integrates smoothly with how training currently works. Would integration into this framework be something you could handle as part of the project, or would that be a separate phase?
Happy to start with the ball physics PoC and go from there. What's your rate / budget estimate for the PoC vs the full project?

Me
Jan 10, 12:04 AM
Yes, integrating with GigaLearnCPP is absolutely something I can handle as part of the project. I’ll take a look at how RocketSim is currently stepped, how states/actions are passed, and make sure the CUDA simulator exposes a compatible (or improved) batched interface so your training loop doesn’t need major rewrites. That wouldn’t need to be a separate phase.

For budget/rates:
Ball physics GPU PoC (arena collisions + batching): $1.5k–$2.5k, ~1–2 weeks

Full GPU simulator integrated with GigaLearnCPP: roughly $12k–$18k, milestone-based, depending on depth (collisions, demos, edge cases, optimizations)

Starting with the PoC makes sense to validate performance and integration before scaling up. Happy to proceed that way.

Jan 10, 12:14 AM
Are you there??

jakejones305
Jan 10, 12:14 AM
Yes I am just trying to figure it out.

jakejones305
Jan 10, 12:14 AM
I cannot afford 12-18k

jakejones305
Jan 10, 12:15 AM
so possibly may have to do this in another direction

Jan 10, 12:15 AM
You say you worked on Rocketsim before? What did you previously do with it?

RL Simmulation*

Me
Jan 10, 12:21 AM
I want to be clear: I haven’t worked on RocketSim specifically before, but I have worked on RL simulation engines and GPU-accelerated physics with similar structure (many parallel envs, fixed timestep, batched states).

Given budget limits, a full GPU rewrite may not make sense right now. A small ball-physics GPU PoC or a partial acceleration / hybrid approach would be a safer first step to see if the gains are worth it.

Happy to keep this lightweight and explore options that fit your budget

jakejones305
Jan 10, 12:24 AM
I’m running GigaLearnCPP and only hitting 77k steps/second. ZealanL (the author) apparently hit 2M SPS with the same stack. So there’s a huge gap somewhere in my setup.
Here’s what I’m working with:
	∙	Dual RTX 5090s (cloud server)
- rtx 5070 (personal pc)
	∙	64GB RAM
	∙	GigaLearnCPP: https://github.com/ZealanL/GigaLearnCPP-Leak
	∙	RocketSim: https://github.com/ZealanL/RocketSim
Would you be able to:
	1.	Profile where the bottlenecks actually are
	2.	Optimize for max throughput
	3.	Get dual GPU working properly if it isn’t
What would something like this cost? I’m guessing it’s way less than a full CUDA rewrite but could still get me major gains.

jakejones305
Jan 10, 12:24 AM
Actually zeleanL managed to get 2million sps per second. Hopefully you’d be able to figure this out

jakejones305
Jan 10, 12:25 AM
Zelean did this with a 3070gpu

Me
Jan 10, 12:26 AM
Yes, I’m aware — ZealanL’s ~2M SPS result on a 3070 shows there’s a lot of headroom with the right design. That kind of throughput usually comes from heavy parallelism, simplified physics paths, and tight data-oriented layouts.

Given that baseline, I’m confident I could investigate and replicate a similar approach (or improve on it) on newer GPUs, starting with a small PoC to understand exactly where the gains come from before scaling further.

Happy to dig into how he achieved it and take it from there.

jakejones305
Jan 10, 12:36 AM
That sounds great. What kind of time scale would this take and costs?

Me
Jan 10, 12:39 AM
If we keep the scope focused and incremental:

Investigation + ball-physics GPU PoC: ~1 week, $500–$800
(replicate the high-throughput approach and validate SPS/accuracy)

Expand toward usable training sim (partial physics): 3–5 weeks, $2k–$4k, milestone-based

This way we first prove we can hit the performance numbers before committing to anything bigger.

RocketSimCUDA = all-in-one GPU rewrite from the start, while our approach is incremental GPU acceleration, starting with ball physics PoC and expanding in steps.

Yes, to hit GPU-scale performance, we do need a new, GPU-friendly collision system. RocketSim’s CPU collisions are sequential and don’t map well to thousands of parallel environments.

For the PoC, we only implement ball collisions, which is much simpler, and later we can expand to full car–ball/car–car collisions.

So based off what I was told, Zelean managed to get 2m sps with a 3070.
Hopefully this should be higher as I have a rtx 5070 on my personal PC and I also have dual rtx 5090s on my server. Unfortunately Gigalearn is not compatible with dual gpus currently. Hopefully you can fix this also

Yes, with your RTX 5070 and dual RTX 5090s, we should be able to exceed Zealan’s 2M SPS on a 3070.

Regarding multi-GPU support: we can design the GPU simulator so it can run batched environments across multiple GPUs, and I can make it compatible with GigaLearnCPP. That would let you utilize both GPUs efficiently, even if the current framework doesn’t natively support dual-GPU training.

Yes, moving the simulation to GPU and batching thousands of environments will significantly decrease iteration time when training your bot with GigaLearnCPP.
